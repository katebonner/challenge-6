# Columbia University Coding Bootcamp - Weather Dashboard: Challenge 6: 

## Description

This project leverages the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to fetch and dislay weather data for any given city. It displays a dashboard populated with the current weather, a 5 day forecast, and the user's recent search history from local memory.
